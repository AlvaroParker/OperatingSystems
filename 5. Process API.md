**What interfaces should the OS present for process creation and control?**

- Fork:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>


int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	printf("hello world (pid: %d)\n", (int) getpid());
	int rc = fork();
	if (rc < 0) {
		// Fork failed	
		fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
		exit(1);
	} else if (rc == 0) {
		// child (new process)
		printf("Hello, I am child (pid: %d)\n", (int) getpid());	
	} else {
		// parent goes down this path (main)
		printf("hello, I am parent of %d (pid:%d)\n",
			rc, (int) getpid());
	}
	return 0;
}
```

- The `wait` system call: Waits for a process ends its execution. 
- The `exec` system call: Given the name of an executable and some arguments, it loads code from that executable and overwrite code segment with it, heap, stack and other aprts are re-initialized.
