# 10. Free-Space Management
- It becomes more difficult when the free space you are managing consist of variable sized units
- Usually arises in user-level memory-allocation libraries (i.e. `malloc()` and `free()`)
- Arises in the OS when using segmentation to implement virtual memory
- Problem known as external fragmentation: The free space gets chopped into little pieces of different sizes and is thus fragmented; request may fail because there is no contiguos space of memory. 

Example: 
In this image we see that the total available space is 20 bytes, however if a process request 15 bytes it will fails since there's not contiguos space of memory that adds up to 15 bytes.

## Assumptions
We have a basic allocation library that has the following functions: 
	- `void *malloc(size_t size)` where `size` is the number of bytes request by the application, it hands back a point (void pointer) to a region with the requested size. 
	- `void free(void *ptr)` takes a single pointer and frees the corresponding chunk that the pointer is pointing to. 
2. The space this library manages is known as the heap, the generic data structured used to manage free space in the heap is some kind of free list
3. Free list containers references to all of the free chunks of space in the managed region of memory. 
4. We are primarily concerned with external fragmentation
5. When a virtual memory is handed out to a client, it cannot be relocated to another location in memory. The region where the pointer is pointing to wont be relocated. 
6. The allocator manages a contiguous region of bytes. For this case in particular we assume that the region is a single fixed size throughout its life. 
## Low level Mechanisms 
### Splitting and Coalescing
Assuming we have the following free list: 

```
head -> {addr: 0, len: 10} -> {addr: 20, len: 10} -> NULL
```

**Splitting:** If we have a request for a single bytes, the allocator performs this action (Splitting). It finds a free chunk of memory that can satisfy the request and split it in two, the first part will be returned to the caller, the second chunk will remain on the list.
For example if we choose the second element on the free list, we will end up with this free list after the allocation: 

```
head -> {addr: 0, len: 10} -> {addr: 21, len: 9} -> NULL
```
